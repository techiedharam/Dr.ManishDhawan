                    <!-- Start Main Content -->
                    <tr>
                        <td>
                            <h2>Dear Friends and Esteemed Colleagues of IOA,</h2>
                            <h2>*|FNAME|*</h2>
                            <p>I have the pleasure to inform and share with you all that the deck is now clear with the order passed by the Hon’ble Delhi High Court on <span class="highlight">4th September 2024</span>. The operative portions of the order are as follows:</p>

                            <div class="important">
                                <p class="quote">“12. I have perused the judgment dated 20.10.2023, more particularly para 64 thereof, wherein it has been observed that serious irregularities have ex facie vitiated the elections held in November 2020. This Court had appointed the learned Administrator to supersede the Executive Committee of IOA with a direction to take appropriate steps as enumerated in para 66 of the said judgment.”</p>
                                <p class="quote">“14. Admittedly, the elections are now likely to be conducted in September/October 2024. The new Committee will take over from the Administrator after the result of said elections is announced, meaning that the Executive Committee elected in 2020, and subsequently superseded, will not be restituted. Thus, the elections for the year 2020 stand nullified for all practical purposes.”</p>
                                <p class="quote">“15. ...the contest by the plaintiff no.1 for a third time as Vice President during the 2020 elections will not be counted towards the third chance under the Code of Conduct. Accordingly, the plaintiff no.1 will be entitled to contest for Vice President in the IOA Elections 2023.”</p>
                            </div>

                            <p><span class="highlight">It now gives me immense pleasure</span> to say that with this order, we will finally have a new Executive Committee in place, without any older members. The time has come for us to <span class="highlight">be aware of our valuable rights</span> and elect a new, clean, and dynamic EC that will support its members when needed.</p>

                            <h3 class="highlight">Key Issues to Reflect Upon</h3>

                            <p>You must have noticed that suddenly, some members became proactive with a common agenda to delay the election and hinder the Ld. Administrator. The demeaning mails sent in the past are highly concerning, as is the pressure exerted by past IOA office bearers on the Administrator.</p>

                            <p>I trust you are all well aware of the situation. Now it's up to us—<span class="highlight">do we stand for a cause to elect an upright EC</span>, or do we allow a few ill-motivated individuals to continue influencing IOA in the way it was run in the past?</p>

                            <h3>Disturbing Actions by CDSL</h3>

                            <p>It's quite alarming how <span class="highlight">the minutes of IOACON 2022</span>, held in Amritsar, were ratified without proper circulation. These minutes were used to advocate for CDSL, despite the agency’s troubling actions in the 2020, 2021, and 2022 elections.</p>

                            <p class="important">Remember, CDSL withheld the Voted Member List for those elections until ordered by the Hon’ble Court, finally disclosing it on <span class="highlight">13th February 2024</span> under court mandate.</p>

                            <p><span class="highlight">Why was CDSL hiding these records?</span> What instructions were they acting upon? If they were neutral, why didn’t they remain transparent?</p>

                            <p class="highlight">Let’s not forget:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>The elections of 2020 were declared null by the Hon’ble Court.</li>
                                <li>The same EC members who benefitted from the nullified election were behind the push for CDSL’s continued involvement.</li>
                                <li>The Hon’ble Court noted glaring irregularities in the management of IOA under the same EC.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h3 class="highlight">The Battle We Fought Together</h3>

                            <p>Without your support, we could not have fought this long, difficult battle. But now, let’s ensure that this hard-earned victory isn't compromised by a few self-serving individuals. <span class="highlight">Let’s elect an EC that truly represents us!</span></p>
